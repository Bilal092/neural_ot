Details to run are provided with each experiment.

In order to understand the principle behind paper, please start with static subset alignment between toy point distributions start with this [notebook](static_subsetting_toy.ipynb).

Examples of results for static toy point clouds are: ![Subset alignment](images/squares_c2_potential.png)
